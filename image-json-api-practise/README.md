#  practice-with-json-image-thingy
A little JS thing I put together a while back to practice retrieving JSON data from External APIs. A Little Bit.. 'Questionable', But Practice is Practice!

[Viewable Here!](https://projects.traviscampbell.info/image-thingy)

Requests Random Images from 1 of 5 Categories: Catboy, Catgirl, Cat, Duck, Cuddle.

For Potentially NSFW Categories, SFW Images Have Been Requested. Though The 'Safety' Of The Images Sent Is At The Discretion Of The Respective API Devs.

(I was pretty new to JS when I stuck this together, so the scripts are quite messy)
