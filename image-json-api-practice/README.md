[Do Note: This May Return Potentially NSFW Images, This Is Not Intentional. Only SFW Images Ae Requested]

Back in my first year at University, I was scratching my head as to what the hell I should put together. Back then, I had very few ideas for 
programming related projects (I could only wish for that to be the case now), and was stuck as to what I should do to get some practice.

I discussed with with a, far more knowledgable, friend of mine and he suggested "do some stuff with APIs".

"APIs you say? Sure thing!" So I made this monstrocity...

(Atleast, that's my excuse anyway)

This is a very simple JavaScript thingy which requests images from some APIs and puts the result in a <img> element.
It also does some other stuff but it's mostly simple and gimmicky.

There are many...  many issues with this (I was crap as JS)
